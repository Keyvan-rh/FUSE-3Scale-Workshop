Click on the *Restlet* component and go to the *Advance* tab in the *Property* window. Select the *Path* tab, add "[aqua]*//localhost*" as the value of the Host, "[aqua]*8080*" for Port and "[aqua]*customer/{id}*" as the Uri Pattern values.

The value of protocol can be selected from its dropdown. Select [blue]*http* as the protocol of your Restlet API.
