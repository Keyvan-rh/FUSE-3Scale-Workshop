== Create a Fuse Integration Project

In JBoss Developer Studio, Create a new project by selecting the *File -> New -> Fuse Integration Project*

{zwsp} +
Enter [aqua]**myfuselab** as the project name, and click *Next*

image::projectName.png[]

CAUTION: You MUST select **2.18.1.redhat-000021** as the Camel Version!!

{zwsp} +
Click *Next*, in Advance project setup, choose **Use a predefined template** and select **Fuse on OpenShift** -> **SprintBoot on OpenShift** and click *Finish*

image::03-template.png[]

JBDS will ask, if you want to change to Fuse perspective, click *Yes*.

=== Create a development property file

Under *src/main/resources* duplicate *application.properties* and with name [aqua]*application-dev.properties*, we are going to use this as the setting during our development time.
You can make a copy by selecting the file and push *Ctrl+C* and *Ctrl+V*. You will be prompted to change the name.

Open the newly created file (*application-dev.properties*) by double clicking on the file name in the *Project Explorer* window and
append the following datasource configuration to the end of the file.

```
#tomcat ports
server.port=9080
#Database configuration
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:h2:mem:mydb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
spring.datasource.username = sa
spring.datasource.password =
spring.datasource.driver-class-name = org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.platform = h2
```

NOTE: we are using H2 in memory database for testing. Thanks to autowiring in SpringBoot, it is now automatically loaded and wired as the default datasource to the Camel context.

=== Create a SQL table

Create a new file under *src/main/resources* by right clicking on the folder itself in the project explorer panel, then select **New** -> **Others** from the menu

image::05-newfile.png[]

{zwsp} +
Type [aqua]*file* as the filter text , then choose **File** under Genetal folder and click next,

image::createFile.png[]

{zwsp} +
In File, put [aqua]*schema.sql* as the file name, and make sure it's under the *myfuselab/src/main/resources* and click on *Finish*.

image::06-schemasql.png[]

Add the following SQL to **schema.sql**

```
CREATE TABLE customerdemo (
	customerID varchar(10) NOT NULL,
	vipStatus varchar(10) NOT NULL ,
	balance integer NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO customerdemo (customerID,vipStatus,balance) VALUES ('A01','Diamond',1000);
INSERT INTO customerdemo (customerID,vipStatus,balance) VALUES ('A02','Gold',500);
```

image::07-sql.png[]

Save your changes by clicking on the save icon on the Menu Bar or by pressing *Crtl+S*

=== Clean the canvas

Double click on the **camel-context.xml** file under **Camel Contexts folder**, you will see the canvas with a Camel Route.

Select the Route by clicking anywhere on the blue background. you will see a delete icon on top of the Route. Click on the delete icon and delete the simple-Route in your canvas.

=== Create a Route

Create a new Route by dragging **Route** component from the *Routing* palette on the right. ReName the Route to [aqua]*customer* by changing the value of *Id* under the *Properties -> Detail* tab.

image::09-route.png[]


=== Add components to our Route

We will use *Timer* component to kick start our Route for now, drag the **TIMER** component from the *Components* palette on the right, and drag it to the Route.

Under *Properties*-> *Advance* tab -> *Consumer*  tab, set **Repeat Count** to **1**

you can save your camel-context.xml file by clicking on the save icon on the menu bar or simply by pushing *Ctrl+S*

WARNING: Make sure that the *Timer component* is selected by clicking on the timer component, otherwise you will not see the correct property tab.

To read data from the datasource, select **SQL** component from the *Components* palette on the right to the Route. Under *Properties*-> *Advance* tab -> *Path*, set **Query** to [aqua]**select * from customerdemo**

image::11-sqlcomponent.png[]

and in *Common* tab set **Data Source** to [aqua]**dataSource**

image::12-datasource.png[]

And lastly select **LOG** component from the *Components* palette to the end of Route. Under *Properties*-> *Detail* tab, set **Message** to [aqua]**${body}**

image::13-log.png[]

Before we start the application, add the database driver dependency in the *pom.xml* file
